Singing In the Rain - Fred Astaire

I'm singing in the rain 
Just singin' in the rain 
What a glorious feeling 
I'm happy again 
I'm laughing at clouds 
So dark up above 
The sun's in my heart 
And I'm ready for love 
Let the stormy clouds chase 
Everyone from the place 
Come on with the rain 
I've a smile on my face 
I walk down the lane 
With a happy refrain 
Singin', just singin' in the rain 
dancing in the rain 
ohh ia ohh ia ia 
I'am happy again 
I'am singing and dancing'in the rain 
... 
dancing and singin'in the rain
