Touch Me - The Doors

Come on, come on,
Come on, come on
Now, touch me, babe.
Can't you see that i am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?

Now, i'm gonna love you
'til the heavens stop the rain.
I'm gonna love you
'til the stars fall from the sky
For you and i.
