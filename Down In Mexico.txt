Down In MÃ©xico - The Coasters

Down in Mexicali
There's a crazy little place that I know
Where the drinks are hotter, than the chili sauce
And the boss is a cat named Joe

(Chorus)
He wears a red bandana
Plays a cool piana (piano is pronounced piana in this song)
In a honky tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash, and a black moustache
In honky tonk, down in Mexico

Well, the first time that I saw him
He was sittin on a piano stool
I said "Tell me man, when does the fun begin?"
He just winked his eye and said "Man, be cool."

(Chorus)
He wears a red bandana
Plays a cool piana
In a honky tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash, and a black moustache
In a honky tonk, down in Mexico

In Mexico...

All of a sudden in walks a chick

In Mexico...

Joe starts playin on a latin kick

In Mexico...

Around her waist she wore three fishnets

In Mexico...

She started dancin with the castanets

In Mexico...

I didn't know just what to expect

In Mexico...

She threw her arms around my neck

In Mexico...

We started dancin all around the floor (In Mexico...)
Until she did a dance I never saw before

So if you're south of the border
I mean down in Mexico
And you wanna get straight
Man, don't hesitate
Just look up a cat named Joe

(Chorus)
He wears a red bandana
Plays a cool piana
In a honky tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash, and a black moustache
In a honky tonk, down in Mexico

[Spoken by Carl Gardner:]

Yeah, como esta usted senorita
Come with me to the border, south of the border, that is
In Mexico, yeah in Mexico
You can get your kicks in Mexico
Crazy, come with me baby, come with me, come with me, crazy, yeah
